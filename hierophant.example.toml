# Example configuration for Hierophant.
# Copy this file to hierophant.toml and adjust as needed.

# REQUIRED: Publicly reachable address of this Hierophant for artifact uploads.
# This is used by clients to upload program inputs and download proofs.
this_hierophant_ip = "hierophant"

# OPTIONAL: Port for gRPC service (default: 9000).
# grpc_port = 9000

# OPTIONAL: Port for HTTP and WebSocket service (default: 9010).
# http_port = 9010

# OPTIONAL: Timeout in seconds for worker responses (default: 30).
# How long to wait for a response from a worker before evicting them.
# worker_response_timeout_secs = 30

# OPTIONAL: Public key for signing messages (default: zero address).
# Key pair used for signing messages to the client and retrieving nonces.
# pub_key = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

# OPTIONAL: Create mock proofs instead of real proofs (default: false).
# Witness generation still happens, but proof generation is skipped.
# mock_mode = false

# OPTIONAL: Directory for storing artifacts on disk (default: "artifacts").
# artifact_store_directory = "artifacts"

# OPTIONAL: Maximum number of stdin artifacts stored (default: 50).
# Artifacts can be large, so we limit how many are stored on disk.
# max_stdin_artifacts_stored = 50

# OPTIONAL: Maximum number of proof artifacts stored (default: 10).
# max_proof_artifacts_stored = 10

# Worker registry settings control when workers are evicted.

# OPTIONAL: Number of strikes before eviction (default: 3).
# Workers get strikes when they fail to respond to requests.
# worker_registry.max_worker_strikes = 3

# OPTIONAL: Maximum seconds between heartbeats before eviction (default: 180).
# Workers must send heartbeats regularly to stay registered.
# worker_registry.max_worker_heartbeat_interval_secs = 180

# OPTIONAL: Maximum minutes a worker can spend on a proof (default: 300).
# Workers taking longer than this are considered dead and evicted.
# worker_registry.proof_timeout_mins = 300

# OPTIONAL: Minutes between required progress updates (default: 0).
# Workers must show at least 1% progress every N minutes or be evicted.
# Set to 0 to disable progress checking.
# worker_registry.worker_required_progress_interval_mins = 0

# OPTIONAL: Maximum minutes for execution report phase (default: 45).
# Time allowed for execution report before proof generation starts.
