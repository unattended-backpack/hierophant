# Hierophant Configuration
# ========================

# OPTIONAL: Port for gRPC service (default: 9000).
# GRPC_PORT=9000

# OPTIONAL: Port for HTTP and WebSocket service (default: 9010).
# HTTP_PORT=9010

# OPTIONAL: Timeout in seconds for worker responses (default: 30).
# How long to wait for a response from a worker before evicting them.
# WORKER_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_SECS=30

# OPTIONAL: Publicly reachable address of this Hierophant for artifact uploads.
# This is used by clients to upload program inputs and download proofs.
# THIS_HIEROPHANT_IP=

# OPTIONAL: Public key for signing messages (default: zero address).
# Key pair used for signing messages to the client and retrieving nonces.
# PUB_KEY=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# OPTIONAL: Create mock proofs instead of real proofs (default: false).
# Witness generation still happens, but proof generation is skipped.
# MOCK_MODE=false

# OPTIONAL: Directory for storing artifacts on disk (default: "artifacts").
# ARTIFACT_STORE_DIRECTORY=artifacts

# OPTIONAL: Maximum number of stdin artifacts stored (default: 50).
# Artifacts can be large, so we limit how many are stored on disk.
# MAX_STDIN_ARTIFACTS_STORED=50

# OPTIONAL: Maximum number of proof artifacts stored (default: 10).
# MAX_PROOF_ARTIFACTS_STORED=10

# Worker Registry Settings
# -------------------------
# These settings control when workers are evicted.

# OPTIONAL: Number of strikes before eviction (default: 3).
# Workers get strikes when they fail to respond to requests.
# MAX_WORKER_STRIKES=3

# OPTIONAL: Maximum seconds between heartbeats before eviction (default: 180).
# Workers must send heartbeats regularly to stay registered.
# MAX_WORKER_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS=180

# OPTIONAL: Maximum minutes a worker can spend on a proof (default: 300).
# Workers taking longer than this are considered dead and evicted.
# PROOF_TIMEOUT_MINS=300

# OPTIONAL: Minutes between required progress updates (default: 0).
# Workers must show at least 1% progress every N minutes or be evicted.
# Set to 0 to disable progress checking.
# WORKER_REQUIRED_PROGRESS_INTERVAL_MINS=0

# OPTIONAL: Maximum minutes for execution report phase (default: 45).
# Time allowed for execution report before proof generation starts.
# WORKER_MAX_EXECUTION_REPORT_MINS=45

# Contemplant Configuration
# ==========================

# OPTIONAL: WebSocket address of the Hierophant to connect to.
# Format: ws://[host]:[port]/ws where port is the Hierophant HTTP port.
# HIEROPHANT_WS_ADDRESS=ws://127.0.0.1:9010/ws

# OPTIONAL: Human-readable name for this Contemplant (default: from names.txt).
# CONTEMPLANT_NAME=

# OPTIONAL: Prover type - "cpu" or "cuda" (default: "cpu").
# CPU proving is slower but doesn't require a GPU.
# PROVER_TYPE=cpu

# OPTIONAL: Moongate CUDA prover endpoint (default: none).
# Only used when prover_type is "cuda". If not set, Contemplant will spin up
# a moongate-server Docker container automatically.
# MOONGATE_ENDPOINT=

# OPTIONAL: Heartbeat interval in seconds (default: 30).
# How often to tell Hierophant that this Contemplant is still alive.
# HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=30

# OPTIONAL: Maximum number of finished proofs stored in memory (default: 2).
# MAX_PROOFS_STORED=2

# OPTIONAL: Magister drop endpoint (default: none).
# Endpoint to notify when this Contemplant should be dropped from its Magister.
# Only set if this Contemplant is managed by a Magister.
# MAGISTER_DROP_ENDPOINT=

# Assessor Settings
# -----------------
# These settings control proof progress monitoring.

# OPTIONAL: Path to log file for progress tracking (default: "./moongate.log").
# MOONGATE_LOG_PATH=./moongate.log

# OPTIONAL: Log polling interval in milliseconds (default: 2000).
# How frequently to check the moongate log file for progress updates.
# WATCHER_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS=2000
